## heading-2 is gothic a1 italic 700

Paragraph is blue eb garamond normal 400 with line-height 0.9; currently we get a sass compilation error if we set base.size to an absolute length unit.

Here's a monospace inline in space mono normal 700 20px:  `fib(90) // in red on white` \
and here's a monospace block in space mono normal 400 8pt with line-height 2:

```javascript
const fib = num => num < 2 ? num : fib(num-1) + fib(num - 2);
console.log(fib(12))
```
